# 📚 Daily Learning Repository

## Why I created this repository

I created this repository to maintain consistency and accountability by pushing my daily **DEV** and **DSA** progress on GitHub.

The main goal is to:
- Build a strong daily learning habit  
- Track my growth over time  
- Stay accountable by making my progress public

## 🚀 What I plan to do as it grows

As this repository grows, I will:

- Document everything properly (concepts, code, learnings, mistakes)
- Add daily progress updates
- Organize content by topics and dates
- Build a solid knowledge base over time

I believe that in the coming months this repo will grow substantially.
